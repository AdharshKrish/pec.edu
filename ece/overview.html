                    Welcome to the Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering! It gives me great pleasure to introduce the Dept. of
                    Electronics and Communication Engineering.
                    The Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering,
                     Pondicherry Engineering College was established right from the inception of the institute in 1985.  It has a strong
                     undergraduate programme in Electronics and Communication Engineering including a B.Tech, M.Tech in Electronics and
                      Communication Engineering and Wireless Communication and Ph.D degrees. The principal mission of the department is to
                      formulate a very strong foundation in the various aspects of Electronics and Communication and provide training in the
                      contemporary areas such as VLSI, Embedded system, Wireless communication, IOT etc.
                    The Department has a dedicated team of faculty members with 11 Professors, 3 Associate professors and 3 Assistant Professors.
                    I am proud to mention that all faculty of this illustrious department are Doctorates and have specialized in key research
                    areas such as Signal Processing, Image processing, Wireless Communication, Optical Networks, Biomedical engineering,
                    Information security and VLSI.Through these faculty members, the students are able to obtain strong fundamentals and
                    excellent analytical training.  The department is ably supported by technical staff consisting of Senior instructors,
                     mechanics and lab attendants who assist the faculty and students.
                    Keeping in mind, the tremendous and fast growth in the areas of Wireless communication and VLSI, curriculum revision is carried
                    t every 4-5 years and last curriculum updation was done in 2018.  An innovative syllabus based on AICTE model curriculum has been
                     framed. The students are given opportunity to obtain a Honours degree or Minor degree in their chosen specialization area. The
                     students also have the opportunity to go for internship in their last semester to companies of their choice and get a hands-on
                     experience with industry trends and be placed in the firms. The department has been able to receive funds from external agencies such as TEQIP, AICTE and DST to setup state-of-the-art
                     laboratories ranging from standard test equipment for the basic laboratories as well as high-end equipment such as Spectrum
                     analysers, Vector network analysers, Microwave test benches, National Instruments Labview WSN platform, and Fibre optic test kits.
                     in addition, the Freescale Semiconductors’' Embedded systems laboratory has been established as an MOU with Freescale Semiconductors
                    and E-yantra robotics Lab from IIT Mumbai are established in the department to provide the latest technologies to the students.

                    The Department also has adequate Computing facilities for UG and PG students. Hence, students of this department have the unique
                    opportunity to augment all theoretical concepts with laboratory training.
                    Two annual events are distinctive to the Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering.  One is the VSNL sponsored panel
                     discussion conducted every year centered on topics of recent interest. Panelists from industry and academics are invited and share
                     their knowledge on the latest advancements in their field.     Another exclusive event, special only to the Dept. of Electronics
                     and Communication Engineering is the Above and Beyond Awards, sponsored by renowned alumni of the Electronics and Communication
                     Engineering Dept., Mr. V. Aroumugam and Mr. V. Muthukumaravelou. Every year this award is distributed to students achieving
                     excellence in academic performance as well as innovative design project. The award involves a citation as well as cash awards.
                    Students of the department are also encouraged to organize workshops, and technical symposiums such as Genesis and EnC Info,
                    to impart in them organizational and management skills which is very important for their overall development.  In addition,
                    students are encouraged to participate in technical and nontechnical events organized in other institutes to get exposure in
                    interdisciplinary fields. The Dept also brings out ECE Tabloid, a department newsletter every semester in which the department
                     activities are published.
                    The Department has continuously progressed over the years and has been bringing out quality B.Tech and M.Tech engineers who are
                    sought after by leading industrial organizations all over the world. Consistently through these years, students of Electronics
                    and Communication Engineering have obtained good placement in campus interviews.  In addition, students have also undertaken higher
                    studies in India and abroad and the Electronics and Communication Engineering department is proud of its alumni who occupy key
                     positions in global organizations such as Microsoft, Apple, Qualcomm, Bosch, HP, Intel, Siemens, to name a few.  The Department
                      has an excellent track record and has been growing in strength with strong alumni base and fresh student talents over the years.
                    With this short introduction, I welcome you to be a part of our journey to achieve the vision of excellence in teaching, training and research.
