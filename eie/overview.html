                    Instrumentation Engineering is for Perfectionists. <br> <p></p>
                    Just imagine your office and home without instruments! You will get a feel of the Stone Age as soon as you start thinking of
                    a world without instruments. Instruments of different nature have become an essential part of our lives, and this is possible
                    only because of the instrumentation and control engineers around us. <br> <p></p>
                    Instrumentation engineering can be referred to as a ‘mixture’ of different subjects that can be the launch pad for many careers.
                    Indeed, instrumentation engineering is an inter-disciplinary branch that includes study of electrical, chemical, electronics
                    as well as computer engineering. Instrumentation and control engineers design manufacture and fix snags in devices or systems
                    that are used to measure or control physical quantities such as temperature, pressure and flow. They step in wherever ‘sensing’
                     of physical quantities is required and work in power plants, chemical plants, manufacturing facilities, oil refineries, the
                     steel industry as well as with drug makers and software and hardware companies, to name a few avenues.

                    Instrumentation engineers typically work for industries with automated processes, such as chemical or manufacturing plants,
                    with the goal of improving system productivity, reliability, safety, optimization and stability. Instrumentation has been the
                    fundamental engine for catalyzing R&D in India. Segments like communication, aerospace and defence, industrial, computers and
                    semiconductors, education and academia, and general-purpose electronics also use instrumentation to validate their devices, designs
                    and deployment. <br><p></p>
                    “Nowadays almost all the industries are going for automation. So, instrumentation and control engineers have a role to play
                    in all the fields where there is automation. The industries are switching almost all their processes to automation.
                     Students are interested in making career in this stream of engineering because there are job opportunities in this domain.”

                MOTTO: “Sensing Change”  <br> <p></p>
                This lab is fully equipped with wide varieties of transducers and sensors available. This lab is mainly to learn about the basic
                operations of sensors and the process where it might be used. In this, sensors and transducers are studied with a deep
                understanding of the working principles and are practically realized. Not only their working, but also conditioning of signals
                and displays are studied. <br><p></p>
                These sensors and signal conditioning circuits are then implemented in various projects and real-time applications in the following
                lab known as the design project lab.
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 notes" >
                As the name suggest, we design all the parameters of the circuit as per the requirement and implement the given components
                to satisfy the requirements. This is a very practical session as we design all the things just by using the data sheets
                 of the provided ICs. <br><p></p>
                This lab has well trained faculties and staffs to assist the students in their learning process and guide them to become
                successful designers of instruments. Its motto is to make pupil understand the sensors like our human body which works by
                processing the inputs given by various sensors like eye, ear etc.

                Microcontrollers and Microprocessors are the foundation of the robotic world and embedded system. From 8051 to PIC microcontrollers and microprocesers every scratch was analyzed and an efficient way of designing was taught. Students were encouraged to come up with innovative ideas.<br><p></p>
                This lab not only dealt with designing but also proved to provide solution effectively and efficiently for a problem statement with a wider scope of discussion. The faculties encourage the students to take up more interesting problem statement and worked towards it as a team. <br><p></p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 notes" >
                The lab also dealt with the troubleshooting techniques and extensively enriched the needs of students in all possible way. The lab experiments are formulated in such a fashion that the students are given opportunity to put forth their theoretical concepts into a real time solution. <br><p></p>
                The lab facilities and equipments available are astounding that creates curiosity among student to immerse themselves in the world of microcontroller. The faculties take a special care of students to enhance the programming ability and mould them as a well-trained, efficient and effective programmer. The students gain a lot of experience from this lab as the atmosphere prevailing is as such as in industries. <br><p></p>
